# Diet ChatBot

This chatbot uses gradio and Gemini API to work as a nutritional assistant.

Here, I am answering the prompt it gave me, and it is the beginning of a long list of responses. Simply continue to answer it's questions to get the best meal plan tailored to your needs!

## To Use

I have found Gemini API works best in Google Colab. Simply get a Gemini API key, upload it to secret spaces in Colab, and run the code. It should run with no issues.
